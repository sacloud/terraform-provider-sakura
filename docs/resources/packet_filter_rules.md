# sakura_packet_filter_rules (Resource)

Manages a Packet Filter's rules

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "sakura_packet_filter" "foobar" {
  name        = "foobar"
  description = "description"
}

resource "sakura_packet_filter_rules" "rules" {
  packet_filter_id = sakura_packet_filter.foobar.id

  expression = [{
    protocol         = "tcp"
    destination_port = "22"
  },
  {
    protocol         = "tcp"
    destination_port = "80"
  },
  {
    protocol         = "tcp"
    destination_port = "443"
  },
  {
    protocol = "icmp"
  },
  {
    protocol = "fragment"
  },
  {
    protocol    = "udp"
    source_port = "123"
  },
  {
    protocol         = "tcp"
    destination_port = "32768-61000"
  },
  {
    protocol         = "udp"
    destination_port = "32768-61000"
  },
  {
    protocol    = "ip"
    allow       = false
    description = "Deny ALL"
  }]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `packet_filter_id` (String) The id of the packet filter that set expressions to

### Optional

- `expression` (Attributes List) List of packet filter expressions (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--expression))
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))
- `zone` (String) The name of zone that the Packet Filter Rules will be created (e.g. `is1a`, `tk1a`)

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the Packet Filter Rules.

<a id="nestedatt--expression"></a>
### Nested Schema for `expression`

Required:

- `protocol` (String) The protocol used for filtering. This must be one of [`http`/`https`/`tcp`/`udp`/`icmp`/`fragment`/`ip`]

Optional:

- `allow` (Boolean) The flag to allow the packet through the filter
- `description` (String) The description of the Packet Filter Expression. The length of this value must be in the range [`1`-`512`]
- `destination_port` (String) A destination port number or port range used for filtering (e.g. `1024`, `1024-2048`)
- `source_network` (String) A source IP address or CIDR block used for filtering (e.g. `192.0.2.1`, `192.0.2.0/24`)
- `source_port` (String) A source port number or port range used for filtering (e.g. `1024`, `1024-2048`)


<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
