## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the SimpleMQ.

### Optional

- `description` (String) The description of the SimpleMQ. The length of this value must be in the range [`1`-`512`]
- `expire_seconds` (Number) The duration in seconds that a message is stored in a queue. Default is 345600 seconds (4 days).
- `icon_id` (String) The icon id to attach to the SimpleMQ
- `tags` (Set of String) The tags of the SimpleMQ.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))
- `visibility_timeout_seconds` (Number) The duration in seconds that a message is invisible to others after being read from a queue. Default is 30 seconds.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the SimpleMQ.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
