## Schema

### Required

- `dns_id` (String) The id of the DNS resource
- `name` (String) The name of the DNS Record resource
- `type` (String) The type of DNS Record. This must be one of [`A`/`AAAA`/`ALIAS`/`CNAME`/`NS`/`MX`/`TXT`/`SRV`/`CAA`/`HTTPS`/`SVCB`/`PTR`]
- `value` (String) The value of the DNS Record.

### Optional

- `port` (Number) The number of port. This must be in the range [`1`-`65535`]
- `priority` (Number) The priority of target DNS Record. This must be in the range [`0`-`65535`]
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))
- `ttl` (Number) The number of the TTL.
- `weight` (Number) The weight of target DNS Record. This must be in the range [`0`-`65535`]

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the DNS Record.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
# foo.tf
import {
  to = sakura_dns_record.record001
  identity = {
    dns_id = "dns-resource-id"
    name   = "www"
    type   = "A"
    // if name/type are sufficient to identify, value can be omitted
    //value  = "192.168.0.1"
  }
}

import {
  to = sakura_dns_record.record002
  identity = {
    dns_id = "dns-resource-id"
    name   = "www2"
    type   = "A"
    value  = "192.168.0.2"
    // other parameters are optional
  }
}

# Run commands
# $ terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated_conf.tf
# $ terraform apply
```
