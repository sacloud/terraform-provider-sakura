  network_interface = {
    switch_id   = sakura_switch.foobar.id
    ip_address  = "192.168.11.101"
    netmask     = 24
    gateway     = "192.168.11.1"
  }

- `icon_id` (String) The icon id to attach to the NFS
- `plan` (String) The plan name of the NFS. This must be one of [`hdd`/`ssd`]
- `size` (Number) The size of NFS in GiB
- `tags` (Set of String) The tags of the NFS.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the NFS.

<a id="nestedatt--network_interface"></a>
### Nested Schema for `network_interface`

Required:

- `ip_address` (String) The IP address to assign to the NFS
- `netmask` (Number) The bit length of the subnet to assign to the NFS. This must be in the range [`8`-`29`]
- `switch_id` (String) The id of the switch to which the NFS connects

Optional:

- `gateway` (String) The IP address of the gateway used by NFS


<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
