# sakura_security_control_evaluation_rule (Resource)

Manages a Security Control's Evaluation Rule.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// service_principal_id and zones/sites required resources
resource "sakura_security_control_evaluation_rule" "foobar1" {
  id         = "server-no-public-ip"
  enabled    = true
  parameters = {
    service_principal_id = "your-service-principal-id"
    targets = ["is1a", "tk1b"]  // [] for all zones
  }
  no_action_on_delete = true
}

// service_principal_id only required resources
resource "sakura_security_control_evaluation_rule" "foobar2" {
  id         = "elb-logging-enabled"
  enabled    = true
  parameters = {
    service_principal_id = "your-service-principal-id"
  }
  no_action_on_delete = true
}

// no parameters required resources
resource "sakura_security_control_evaluation_rule" "foobar3" {
  id      = "addon-threat-detections"
  enabled = true
  no_action_on_delete = true
}

### Optional

- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the Evaluation Rule is enabled
- `no_action_on_delete` (Boolean) No action when the resource is deleted. Keep existing Evaluation Rule as is.
- `parameters` (Attributes) The parameters of the Evaluation Rule (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--parameters))
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `iam_roles_required` (Set of String) The set of IAM roles required for the Evaluation Rule

<a id="nestedatt--parameters"></a>
### Nested Schema for `parameters`

Optional:

- `service_principal_id` (String) The Service Principal ID associated with the Evaluation Rule
- `targets` (List of String) The list of targets for the Evaluation Rule


<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
